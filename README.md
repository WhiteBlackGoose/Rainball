### What is this project about?

It is a small sample of what you can do using brand new [MxEngine](https://github.com/asc-community/MxEngine). It uses `Primitives::CreateSurface()` function to generate waves on water surface. There are no direct calls to graphic api or custom shaders involved, application only uses engine abstractions to render a single mesh with high reflectance factor.

### About MxEngine

Is an open-source game engine which allows you to work with 3D graphics, create custom objects behaviour, play 3D sounds, and much-much more.
This project's aim is to show how you can utilize its API and create some cool stuff. It you are interested, feel free to 
[contribute](https://github.com/asc-community/MxEngine/issues/4) to the engine.
